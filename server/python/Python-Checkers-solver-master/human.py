        Given a board, find a move and return a tuple of the new board

        Hints provides the user with a list of possible moves to choose
        from and is currently the only way to use this function.
        If you have problems with the unbuffered read charIO.getch(),
        use charIO.getchBuffered() which reads input in a buffered
        manner (you must press carriage return).  The charIO module has
        only been tested on CentOS 6.6 linux and Windows.  It will work
        with PyCharm but you will may need to set the debug/run configuration
        to emulate a terminal in console output.
