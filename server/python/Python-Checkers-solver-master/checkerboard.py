    CheckerBoard - Class for representing a checkerboard
    and making legal moves.
    
    All references to players in that are accessible externally to this
    class should use the pawn names. 
    
    Note that this implementation is designed for readability, not
    efficiency.  There are many changes that could be made to
    improve the speed of this class. As an example, the board could
    be represented as a single list of 32 positions.  

    You should not be making changes to the design for this
    assignment, but if you want to have fun later, redesigning
    it for efficiency could be fun and improve the number of plys
    that can be efficiently searched.
    
    Board notation:
    Board is arranged as with black pieces on top, red pieces on bottom
    Positions are denoted (row, column).
    Examples form the initial board setup before play begins
        left-most red pawn in the row closest to the red player:  (7,0)
        right-most black pawn farthest from the red player:  (0,7)
    Note that playable columns alternate.  In row 0, they are 1, 3, 5, 7
    and in row 1 they are 0, 2, 4, 6 making a modulo 2 counting scheme
    useful for determining which columns are valid.
    
    Initial board:
       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
    0  .  b  .  b  .  b  .  b
